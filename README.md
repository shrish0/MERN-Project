# MERN Project

Welcome to the MERN Project repository! This project contains a collection of applications built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), demonstrating various functionalities from simple games to practical applications.

## Features

1. **Tic Tac Toe**  
   A classic game of Tic Tac Toe, implemented with React for a simple, interactive experience. Users can play against each other locally, with real-time updates and basic game logic for an engaging match.

2. **Calculator**  
   A straightforward, responsive calculator built with React, supporting basic arithmetic operations. This app serves as an example of handling state and user input effectively in a React component.

3. **Learning Management System (LMS)**  
   A more complex application designed to manage educational content and user progress. This LMS module includes features like course management, user roles (e.g., student and instructor), and progress tracking. The backend, built with Node and Express, connects to MongoDB to handle data persistence.

4. **Carpool Application**  
   An application designed to connect users for carpooling opportunities. Users can post ride offers, search for available rides, and connect with others for shared transportation. This app demonstrates CRUD operations and user interactions within the MERN stack.
